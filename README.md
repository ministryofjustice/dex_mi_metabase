# TODO list
- Specify the version of metabase we want to use to avoid the problem may caused by new version 
  e.g.  db migration etc.
- Create a docker image based on the metabase image, then we can install some tools we want for our own usage 
- Write a script to export/import the dashboard and reports from different servers
- Add secret key as MB_ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY
